# Bitscope-java-API

<h1> Currently in alpha </h1>

Currently the API is in alpha. This means there are quite a lot of bugs, missing functionalities and of cource incomplete code.

Check the Main.java in order to see the example code.
Working:
- get voltage graph array
- select channel
- Set voltage range
- Set timebase => still a bit unreliable in setting diffirent timebases
- Select trigger channel
- get sample frequency
- Chop channels => still needs a bit of love
- Function generator
- Logic analyzer

ToDo:
- Set trigger_level => currently at zero-crossing

Future functions
- IO control? unconfirmed functionality
